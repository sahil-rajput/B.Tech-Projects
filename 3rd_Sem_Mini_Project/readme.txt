ABOUT PROJECT:

This project is a Menu Driven program which contain two problems, one is “ANRGY PROFESSOR” and second is “LUCKY NUMBER”.
I did this project by Command Line Argument So you have to specify name of the text file before running.

GETTING STARTED:

As this project has COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT So you have to put file name while running the program then you have to input 
choice(i.e. Choice 1 or Choice 2) by KEYBOARD. 
Make sure test files also in same folder in which program is saved.


INPUT FORMAT:

1. For Angry Professor Problem

First line contain number of test cases T,the next line contain two space separated integers A and P. A will be strength of students and P shows Present Students.
Third line contain Strength of Students.

HOW TO RUN AND COMPILE:


To compile and run simply compile it and when you execute or run write text file name (like I write “ angryprof.txt ” which contain inputs of problem 1(angry professor)) and
after that it will ask you for your choice 1 or 2 (Decide on what input file you gave.)

After that it will show you the Output on the screen.


I try to make this program userfriendly .So if your input format is wrong (i.e You write characters or symbols anything inside the file) it will show you the error message
and if FILE is empty it will also show you that.

Here is the sample. How to Compile and Run this project on LINUX (I used Mac OS).
